=========== Necessary TODO ===========

- PI Control algorithm ✅
- Q-format Number Logic ✅
- FIR, IIR Filter ✅
- UART, I2C, SPI comm. protocols ✅
- Learn DMA Usage (Basic to Advanced) ✅
- UART Protocol for data transfer reliability ✅
- Learn modern PWM Techniques ✅
- FreeRTOS basics ✅
- CMake Basics

=========== Optional TODO ===========

- Double-buffering with DMA (to update one frame while DMA transmits another - which is used in smooth LCD animation or real-time UI systems)
